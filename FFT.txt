Dominant Period Detection (FFT Analysis):

Load time series data from an Excel file.

Check whether the time intervals are uniform. If not, interpolate the data to create a uniformly spaced time series.

For each feature (e.g., maximum diameter, elongation):

Detrend and normalize the data.

Perform FFT to compute the power spectrum.

Identify the dominant periodicity (the period with the maximum spectral power).

Plot the power spectrum and highlight the dominant period.

Signal Reconstruction Using Dominant Frequencies:

For each feature:

If necessary, interpolate the original signal.

Remove the linear trend.

Perform FFT on the detrended signal.

Select the top 3 frequencies with the highest power (excluding the zero frequency).

Reconstruct the signal using only these dominant frequencies by inverse FFT.

Add the trend back to the reconstructed signal.

Compare the reconstructed signal to the original one by calculating the RÂ² score.

Plot the original and reconstructed signals for visual comparison.
